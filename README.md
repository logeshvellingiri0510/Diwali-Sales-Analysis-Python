# Diwali Sales Data Analysis
# Project Overview
This project performs an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Diwali festival sales data to uncover key customer purchasing patterns and sales trends. The primary goal is to derive actionable business insights that can help optimize sales strategies, target marketing efforts, and improve overall customer experience and revenue in future festive seasons.

# Key Objectives
Improve Customer Experience: Identify potential customers across different demographics (gender, age group, state, and occupation).

Optimize Sales: Determine the most selling Product Categories and specific Products to assist in inventory planning and meeting customer demand.

Data-Driven Insights: Provide clear, summarized conclusions to inform stakeholders for strategic decision-making.

# Analysis Methodology

# Data Loading & Cleaning:

Load the sales data from the CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame.

Identify and handle missing values (NaN) and drop irrelevant columns.

Correct and convert data types (e.g., changing 'Amount' from float to integer).

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Analyze sales distribution based on Gender, Age Group, and Marital Status.

Examine State/Region-wise sales performance.

Study sales trends across different Occupations.

Identify top-selling Product Categories and Product IDs (in terms of both total orders and sales amount).

# Visualization:

Utilize Countplots and Barplots (from Seaborn/Matplotlib) to visually represent all key insights.

Show total sales amount vs. various demographic groups.

# Key Findings (Example Insights)

The majority of buyers are married women in the 26-35 age group.

The top-spending states are Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, and Karnataka.

Customers working in IT, Healthcare, and Aviation sectors exhibit the highest purchasing power.

The most sold product categories are Food, Clothing, and Electronics.
